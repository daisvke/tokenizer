### üîπ **Platforms and Their Programming Languages**

These are the blockchain platforms where you can deploy tokens:

| Platform      | Language Used    | Notes                              |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Ethereum**  | Solidity         | Most common for smart contracts    |
| **Solana**    | Rust / C / C++   | Known for high performance         |
| **Cardano**   | Haskell / Plutus | More academic, functional language |
| **Tezos**     | Michelson        | Stack-based, low-level             |
| **BNB Chain** | Solidity         | Same tools as Ethereum             |

So if you choose Ethereum, you‚Äôll need to **learn Solidity**, the smart contract language.

### üîπ **Development Tools (Truffle, Remix, Hardhat, IDEs)**

These tools help you **write, test, and deploy smart contracts**. They‚Äôre mostly used with Ethereum-compatible platforms.

#### 1. **Remix**

* **Type**: Web-based IDE (no installation needed)
* **Best for**: Beginners
* **Features**:

  * Write Solidity contracts in-browser
  * Compile, test, and deploy from your browser
  * Has built-in test blockchain and debugger

‚úÖ *Simple and easy to use*

---

#### 2. **Truffle**

* **Type**: Full development framework (CLI-based)
* **Best for**: Intermediate to advanced users
* **Features**:

  * Compile, migrate, test, and deploy smart contracts
  * Network management
  * Uses Ganache (local test blockchain)

‚úÖ *Good for full-stack dApp development*

---

#### 3. **Hardhat**

* **Type**: Modern Ethereum dev environment (CLI + plugins)
* **Best for**: Advanced projects and custom setups
* **Features**:

  * Fast and flexible
  * Plugin support (e.g. ethers.js, waffle, TypeScript)
  * Better debugging and error messages than Truffle
  * Built-in local testnet (Hardhat Network)

‚úÖ *Preferred by many modern Ethereum developers*

---

#### 4. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**

* **Examples**: VS Code, IntelliJ
* **Use**: Write Solidity and scripts
* Usually used with Truffle or Hardhat
* Supports extensions for Solidity, web3, etc.

‚úÖ *Powerful for large or multi-file projects*

### üî∏ Summary of Differences

| Tool        | Type            | Ease of Use | Best For                   |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| **Remix**   | Web IDE         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       | Quick testing, beginners   |
| **Truffle** | CLI Framework   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê         | Full dApp projects         |
| **Hardhat** | Dev Environment | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê        | Custom, modern development |
| **IDE**     | General Editor  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê        | Flexible development setup |


## Useful commands
```
# Install/uninstall module
npm install [--save-dev] module_name
npm uninstall module_name

# Run a script
npx hardhat run path/to/script

# Deploy contract on the sepolia testnet
npx hardhat run ../deployment/deploy.js --network sepolia

# Publish sepolia smart contract on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia "0x67f809fbde3fbdf462002e7e933525989d043cff" 'Hello World!'

npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS INITIAL_SUPPLY

```

## Notes

### ERC-20

An ERC-20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC-20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

### Token parsing
have to parse ether sent to the constructor but not the other values like transfert amount
